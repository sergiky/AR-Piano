AR Piano is a simulator that utilizes [MRTK2](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk2/?view=mrtkunity-2022-05) that simulate an "invisible piano" overlaid on top of a physical one, actually only designed for 61 keys piano. This was a game project in one of my sbujects.

I am currently unable to dedicate the necessary time to complete this project and I would like that someone complete it.

My unique condition is that this project must be distributed freely for all users that want to learn the basic use of a piano.
